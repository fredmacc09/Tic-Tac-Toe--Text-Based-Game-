Tic-Tac-Toe--Text-Based-Game-
=============================

A text based Tic-Tac-Toe game.

This was a program to get introduced and familiar with 2D arrays. 
The Tic Tac Toe game implemtation was a fun way to show the understanding 
and usage of 2D arrays. Arrays are my favorite data types to use since they
are great on efficiency, waste less memory, and makes it easy to keep track 
of different types of data.This current project works but has a glitch.
The user or AI can overwrite the positon of either player. I plan to have this
bug fixed soon and will update the java class files.
